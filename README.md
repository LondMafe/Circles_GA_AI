# Genetic Algorithm Biggest Circle Generator

**Circle Space:** Creates a canvas with a random amount of circles between 10-30, the coordinates and radius of the circles are also randomly generated. This canvas with circles is saved as a PNG file. The code also saves the info about each circle on a TXT file, that will later be read by the gen archive.

**Gen:** Uses a genetic algorith to fit the biggest circle possible in the blank spaces of the canvas without colliding with the other circles.

*Note:* The archives in the folders "circlespace" and "gen" are just the previous versions, the final files are *"circlespace4"* and *"gen5"*.
